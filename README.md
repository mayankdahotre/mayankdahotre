Hi, I'm Mayank! 👋

I’m deeply passionate about Robotics, Computational Mechanics, and AI for Control Systems. My research interests lie at the intersection of robotic path planning, trajectory optimization, reinforcement learning for control, and numerical simulations.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on robot kinematics, dynamics, and control, diving deep into ROS, Gazebo, and computational modeling. I've been fortunate to work on projects involving Manipulator Kinematics (Open Manipulator X, Orangewood 6 DOF), SCARA and RRR Jacobian derivations, and CFD simulations of airfoil flows. I’ve also tackled FEA of mechanical components, with applications in ATV design and structural analysis.

Beyond research, I’ve been actively involved in leadership roles—serving as Events Executive for Amalthea, leading Documentation and Outreach for the Student Academic Council, and coordinating academic-industrial initiatives at IIT Gandhinagar.

In 2024, I’m honing my expertise in Control Systems, Probabilistic ML, and Computational Robotics. I’m also exploring quantitative finance, working on stochastic modeling and analytics. My long-term goal? To blend AI with robotics for real-world automation challenges.

✨ Side Quests

Deep Learning Enthusiast – completed Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization and currently exploring RL for robotic control

ROS & Simulation Geek – built custom URDF/XACRO files, simulated manipulators, and developed trajectory planners

Tech + Leadership – helped bring Amalthea back offline, worked on MetaIITGN, and coordinated outreach initiatives

📍 Outside Work

Born and raised in India, I find joy in reading about control theory, experimenting with numerical methods, and hitting the gym to build an aesthetic physique! Also, I enjoy a good plate of chicken biryani (because priorities, right?).
